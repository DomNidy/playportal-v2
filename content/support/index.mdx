### Welcome to Playportal Support!

## What is Playportal?

Playportal is a platform that simplifies the process of creating videos for your music. 
In more detail, we allow you to upload an audio file, provide an image file (optionally); 
and we will create a video for you. You can then download the video and share it on social media platforms.

## Do you support direct uploads of created videos?

We currently do not support direct uploads of created videos. In order to post your videos on platforms like YouTube,
you will need to download the video from Playportal, then upload it manually.

However, this feature (direct uploads) is on our roadmap and we will update you once it is available.
The platforms we are considering initially are YouTube uploads.
